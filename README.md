# Fire webapp

The idea of this web application is to show users the fires that are going on given a location. By default shows user location first.
It is possible to change the dataset and shows information about more locals. The web application is ready for this.

It also provides warnings and the ability for a user to report a fire that is not yet in the information displayed. Thus, it is possible to update the information and prevent many accidents.
